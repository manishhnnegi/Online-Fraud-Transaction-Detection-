# Online-Fraud-Transaction-Detection-System

# Goal

2. The classifier estimate the probability for each feature vector to be a fraud.
3. These probabilities are used as the fraud scores associated with the authorized transactions. 
4. Fraud score helps investigators by raising alerts on the most suspicious transactions.
5. The classifier is one of the building blocks of Online Fraud Transaction Detection System (FTDS). 
6. Customized Machine learning ,Staking, Prequential validation, 
7. Library Used: flask , heroku, sklearn
